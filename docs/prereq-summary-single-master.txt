Summary: 4 VMs recommended for single master install.  Additional VM if NFS services are needed.
* Infrastructure (physical or virtual machines, assuming virtual):
* Master (1 VM Required)
  * 32GB RAM
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 20GB Disk (for OS) **(put all the space in '/' partition.  Do not bother splitting up /var, /usr, /home, etc...)**
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.5 upgraded to latest patchset
* Container Hosts (3 VMs required) 
  * 32GB RAM
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 20GB Disk (for OS)
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.5 upgraded to latest patchset
  * 200GB Disk (for CNS, raw/unformatted)
* Additional VM if NFS is needed
  * 8GB RAM (no more memory is needed)
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 100GB Disk
  * RHEL7.5 upgraded to latest patchset
* Internet connectivity is recommended
  * HTTPS Whitelist these trusted hosts in proxies and/or firewalls (if needed)
	For content (RPM packages):
	- subscription.rhn.redhat.com
	- cdn.redhat.com
	For docker registry:
	- registry.access.redhat.com
* DNS Requirements 
  * Choose a domain name for Openshift – Example: ocp.example.com
* Create a wildcard entry in parent DNS zone that points to master VM
* Ex:  A record '*.ocp' IN zone example.com
**This DNS record is absolutely required and is often the most time consuming task to get done (internal approvals are likely required)**

Activate the Openshift subscriptions provided by Red Hat. If using a Satellite Server, synchronize the relevant channels.
   * rhel-7-server-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms
   * rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms
   * rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms

Additional Considerations:
   1. RHEL7.5 vanilla is recommended (unmodified ISO as it comes from RH)
    - The “Minimum” installation is recommended
   2. SELinux must be in “Enforcing” (default in vanilla image)
    - Test with 'getenforce'
   3. NetworkManager must be enabled (default in vanilla image)
    - Test with 'nmcli dev status'
   4. iptables must be enabled (default in vanilla image)
    - Test with 'systemctl status iptables'
