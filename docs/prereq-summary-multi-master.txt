Summary: 9 VMs recommended for multi master install.  Additional VM if NFS services are needed.
* Infrastructure (physical or virtual machines, assuming virtual):
* Master Nodes (3 VMs required)
  * 32GB RAM (more is better)
  * 4 vCPUs (more is better)
  * 20GB Disk (for OS)
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Infrastructure Nodes (3 VMs required)
  * 32GB RAM (more is better)
  * 4 vCPUs (more is better)
  * 20GB Disk (for OS)
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Application Nodes (3 VMs recommended) 
  * 32GB RAM (more is better)
  * 4 vCPUs (more is better)
  * 20GB Disk (for OS)
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
  * 50GB Disk (for CNS, raw/unformatted)
* Additional VM if NFS is needed
  * 8GB RAM
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 100GB Disk (more is better)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Internet connectivity is recommended
  * HTTPS Whitelist these trusted hosts in proxies and/or firewalls (if needed)
	For content (RPM packages):
	- subscription.rhn.redhat.com
	- cdn.redhat.com
	For docker registry:
	- registry.access.redhat.com

* DNS Requirements 
  * Choose a domain name for Openshift – Example: ocp.example.com
* Create a wildcard entry in parent DNS zone that points to infra structure VMs (round robin)
* Ex:  A record '*.ocp' IN zone 'example.com' (resolves to all three infra nodes)
**This DNS record is absolutely required and is often the most time consuming task to get done (internal approvals are likely required)**

Activate the Openshift subscriptions provided by Red Hat. If using a Satellite Server, synchronize the relevant channels to the Satellite Server.
   * rhel-7-server-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms
   * rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms
   * rh-gluster-3-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms

Additional Considerations:
   1. RHEL7.4 (Vanilla ISO is recommended)
    - The “Minimum” installation is recommended
   2. SELinux must be in “Enforcing” (this is the default in vanilla image)
   3. NetworkManager must be enabled (this is the default in vanilla image)
   4. iptables must be enabled (this is the default in vanilla image)
